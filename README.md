Helping GoDaddy GoPotty

## Overview
pottybotty is a Slack bot that notifies GoDaddy employees when restroom stalls (potties) become available. It was developed as a hackathon project for GoDaddy's 2019 summer intern hackathon.

pottybotty runs on Node.js and subscribes to [pottyapi](https://github.com/mattbudiman/pottyapi) to receive notifications on potty state change.
